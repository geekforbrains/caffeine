<p>We take a very different view of client communications. Effective communication is both an 'art' and a 'science'... we have demonstrated expertise in both areas.</p>
<p>Our programs are based on the science of communication, on how people think, act and make decisions.</p>
<p>Our delivery is based on thirty plus years of understanding about what advisors actually do.</p>
<p>Our perspective is a global one... we have worked with advisors and firms around the world and continue to have clients in the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Hong Kong, Australia and Mainland China.</p>
